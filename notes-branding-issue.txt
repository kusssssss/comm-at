Issue: Share preview on iOS shows "Exclusive Streetwear Collective" instead of "Exclusive Secret Society"

Analysis:
1. The index.html Open Graph tags are already correct - they show "Exclusive Secret Society"
2. The share preview is likely coming from:
   - Cached data on the device
   - The published version hasn't been updated yet
   - Or there's a server-side meta tag generator

The current index.html has:
- og:title: "COMM@ | Exclusive Secret Society"
- og:description: "Invitation-only secret society. Exclusive marks, secret gatherings, and inner circle access in South Jakarta."

Solution: Need to republish the site to update the cached Open Graph data.
