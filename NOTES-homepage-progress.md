# Homepage Redesign Progress

## Completed
1. Events Hero Section - Full viewport with filters (Now/Upcoming/This Week, Location, Search)
2. Merch Section - "The Drop" with product grid showing Varsity Jacket and Noodle Bowl Chain
3. Community Section - Manifesto, How It Works (4 steps), Code of Conduct (6 rules)
4. Footer with navigation links

## Issues Found
1. Events showing "No events match your filters" - need seed data
2. Merch images showing broken/placeholder - need to verify image URLs
3. Prices showing "Inquire" instead of actual prices - need to update drop data

## Next Steps
1. Add 8 sample events with cover images
2. Add 8 sample merch items with images and prices
3. Update existing drops with proper pricing
